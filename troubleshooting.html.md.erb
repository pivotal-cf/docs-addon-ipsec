<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic provides instructions to verify that strongSwan-based <%= vars.product_full %> works
with your <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment and general recommendations
for troubleshooting <%= vars.product_short %>.

## <a id='verify-ipsec'></a>Verify that <%= vars.product_short %> Works with <%= vars.platform_name %>

To verify that <%= vars.product_short %> works between two hosts, you can check that traffic is encrypted in the deployment with `tcpdump`, perform the ping test, and check the logs with the steps below.

1. Check traffic encryption and perform the ping test. Select two hosts in your deployment with <%= vars.product_short %> enabled and note their IP addresses. These are referenced below as `IP-ADDRESS-1` and `IP-ADDRESS-2`.
	1. SSH into `IP-ADDRESS-1`.
	<pre class="terminal">$ ssh IP-ADDRESS-1</pre>
	1. On the first host, run the following, and allow it to continue running.
	<pre class="terminal">$ tcpdump host IP-ADDRESS-2</pre>
	1. From a separate command line, run the following:
	<pre class="terminal">$ ssh IP-ADDRESS-2</pre>
	1. On the second host, run the following:
	<pre class="terminal">$ ping IP-ADDRESS-1</pre>
	1. Verify that the packet type is ESP. If the traffic shows `ESP` as the packet type, traffic is successfully encrypted. The output from `tcpdump` looks similar to the following:
	<pre class="terminal">03:01:15.242731 IP IP-ADDRESS-2 > IP-ADDRESS-1: ESP(spi=0xcfdbb261,seq=0x3), length 100</pre>
1. Open the `/var/log/daemon.log` file to obtain a detailed report, including information pertaining to the type of certificates you use, and to verify an established connection exists.
1. Navigate to your Installation Dashboard, and click **Recent Install Logs** to view information regarding your most recent deployment. Search for "ipsec" and the status of the <%= vars.product_short %> job.
1. Run `ipsec statusall` to return a detailed status report regarding your connections. The typical path for this binary: `/var/vcap/packages/strongswan-x.x.x/sbin`. `x.x.x` represents the version of strongSwan packaged into <%= vars.product_short %>.

If you experience symptoms that <%= vars.product_short %> does not establish a secure connection, return to the [Installing <%= vars.product_full %>](./installing.html) topic and review your installation.

If you encounter issues with installing <%= vars.product_short %>, refer to the [Troubleshoot <%= vars.product_short %>](#troubleshoot-ipsec) section of this topic below.

## <a id='troubleshoot-ipsec'></a>Troubleshoot <%= vars.product_short %>

### <a id="ipsec-installation-issues"></a> <%= vars.product_short %> Installation Issues

#### Symptom
Unresponsive applications or incomplete responses, particularly for large payloads

#### Explanation: Packet Loss
<%= vars.product_short %> packet encryption increases the size of packet payloads on host VMs.
If the size of the larger packets exceeds the maximum transmission unit (MTU) size of the host VM,
packet loss might occur when the VM forwards those packets.

If your VMs were created with an Amazon PV stemcell,
the default MTU value is 1500 for both host VMs and the application containers.
If your VMs were created with Amazon HVM stemcells, the default MTU value is 9001.
Garden containers default to 1500 MTU.

#### Solution

Either decrease the MTU of the application containers or increase the MTU of the application container VMs.
The MTU of the application containers must be at least 100 MTU lower than the MTU of the application container VMs.

Do one of the following:

* Decrease the MTU of the application containers.
    1. In the <%= vars.app_runtime %> tile configuration, click **Networking**.
    1. Decrease **Applications Network Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) (in bytes)** from the default value of 1454 to 1354.


* Increase the MTU of the application container VMs.
<br><br>
    On a command line, run the following command

    ```
    ifconfig NETWORK-INTERFACE mtu MTU-VALUE
    ```
    Where:
    * `NETWORK-INTERFACE` is the network interface used to communicate with other VMs.
    * `MTU-VALUE` is a value greater than 1500. VMware recommends a headroom of 100.

	 For example:
	 <pre class="terminal">
    $ ifconfig example-interface mtu 1600
    </pre>

<hr>
#### Symptom
Unresponsive applications or incomplete responses, particularly for large payloads

#### Explanation: Network Degradation
<%= vars.product_short %> data encryption increases the size of packet payloads. If the number of requests and the size of your files are large, the network might degrade.

#### Solution
Scale your deployment by allocating more processing power to your VM CPU or GPUs, which, additionally, decreases the packet encryption time. One way to increase network performance is to compress the data before encryption. This approach increases performance by reducing the amount of data transferred.

<hr>
####<a name='duplicate'></a> Symptom

<%= vars.product_short %> fails to deploy with one of the following errors:

<pre class="terminal">
<%= vars.product_short %> detected that the CA certificate and instance certificate have the same serial number.
Please ensure that the serials are not the same and redeploy.`
</pre>

<pre class="terminal">
<%= vars.product_short %> detected that the CA certificate and instance certificate have the same subject.
Please ensure that the subjects are not the same and redeploy.`
</pre>

<pre class="terminal">
Invalid CA/instance certificate.
This might be caused by a duplicate subject or serial number.`
</pre>

#### Explanation: Same Serial Number/Common Name

Every certificate in the certificate chain must have a unique serial number and common name,
also called the subjectName.

For example, a root certificate cannot have the same common name as an intermediate certificate;
an instance certificate cannot have the same serial number as an intermediate certificate.

#### Solution

Follow the steps in [Procedure 1: Rotate the Instance Certificate and Instance Private Key](./credentials.html#rotate-cert)
to generate a new chain of certificates and replace the old chain.

When you generate the new certificates, ensure no certificates have a duplicate serial numbers or common names.

### <a id="ipsec-runtime-issues"></a><%= vars.product_short %> Runtime Issues

#### Symptom
* App fails to start with the following message:
<pre class="terminal">FAILED
Server error,
status code: 500,
error code: 10001,
message: An unknown error occurred.</pre>
The Cloud Controller log shows it is unable to communicate with Diego due to `getaddrinfo` failing.

* Deployment fails with a similar error message:
<pre class="terminal">FAILED
diego_database-partition-620982d595434269a96a/0 (a643c6c0-bc43-411b-b011-58f49fb61a6f)' is not running after update. Review logs for failed jobs: etcd
</pre>


#### Explanation: Split Brain `consul`
This error indicates a “split brain” issue with Consul.

#### Solution
Confirm this diagnosis by checking the `peers.json` file from /var/vcap/store/consul\_agent/raft. If it is null, then there might be a split brain. To fix this problem, follow these steps:

1. Run `monit stop` on all Consul servers:
1. Run `rm -rf /var/vcap/store/consul_agent/` on all Consul servers.
1. Run `monit start consul_agent` on all Consul servers one at a time.
1. Restart the consul\_agent process on the Cloud Controller VM. You might need to restart consul\_agent on other VMs, as well.

<hr>
#### Symptom
You see that communication is not encrypted between two VMs.

#### Explanation: Error in Network Configuration
The <%= vars.product_short %> BOSH job is not running on either VM. This problem could happen if both <%= vars.product_short %> jobs crash, both <%= vars.product_short %> jobs fail to start, or the subnet configuration is incorrect. There is a momentary gap between the time when an instance is created and when BOSH sets up <%= vars.product_short %>. During this time, data can be sent unencrypted. This length of time depends on the instance type, IAAS, and other factors. For example, on a t2.micro on Amazon Web Services (AWS), the time from networking start to <%= vars.product_short %> connection was measured at 95.45 seconds.

#### Solution
Set up a networking restriction on host VMs to only allow <%= vars.product_short %> protocol and block the normal TCP/UDP traffic. For example, in AWS, configure a network security group with the minimal networking setting as shown below and block all other TCP and UDP ports.

<table border='1' class='nice'>
	<caption>Additional AWS Configuration</caption>
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Protocol</th>
<th>Port Range</th>
<th>Source</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Custom Protocol</td>
<td>AH (51)</td>
<td>All</td>
<td>10.0.0.0/16</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Custom Protocol</td>

<td>10.0.0.0/16</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Custom UDP Rule</td>
<td>UDP</td>
<td>500</td>
<td>10.0.0.0/16</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When configuring a network security group, <%= vars.product_short %> adds an additional layer to the original communication protocol. If a certain connection is targeting a port number, for example port 8080 with TCP, it actually uses IP protocol 50/51 instead. Due to this detail, traffic targeted at a blocked port might be able to go through.</p>

<hr>

#### Symptom
You see unencrypted app messages in the logs.

#### Explanation: `etcd` Split Brain

#### Solution
1. Check for split brain etcd by connecting with BOSH `ssh` into each etcd node: <pre class="terminal">$ curl localhost:4001/v2/members</p>
1. Check if the members are consistent on all of etcd. If a node has only itself as a member, it has formed its own cluster and developed "split brain." To fix this issue, SSH into the split brain VM and run the following commands:
	1. <pre class="terminal">$ sudo su -</pre>
	1. <pre class="terminal"># monit stop etcd</pre>
	1. <pre class="terminal"># rm -r /var/vcap/store/etcd</pre>
	1. <pre class="terminal"># monit start etcd</pre>

1. Check the logs to confirm the node rejoined the existing cluster.

<hr>

#### Symptom

<%= vars.product_short %> deployment fails with <code>Error filling in template 'pre-start.erb'</code>:

<pre class="terminal">
Error 100: Unable to render instance groups for deployment. Errors are:
   - Unable to render jobs for instance group 'consul_server-partition-f9c4b18fd83cf3114d7f'. Errors are:
     - Unable to render templates for job 'ipsec'. Errors are:
       - Error filling in template 'pre-start.erb' (line 12: undefined method `each_with_index' for #<String:0x0055e9e36d2c98>)
   - Unable to render jobs for instance group 'nats-partition-f9c4b18fd83cf3114d7f'. Errors are:

       - Error filling in template 'pre-start.erb' (line 12: undefined method `each_with_index' for #<String:0x0055e9e36d2c98>)
</pre>

#### Explanation: Typographical or syntax error in deployment descritor YAML syntax

#### Solution
Check the deployment descriptor YAML syntax for the CA certificates entry:

```
releases:
- {name: ipsec, version: 1.9.9}

addons:
- name: ipsec-addon
  jobs:
  - name: ipsec
    release: ipsec
    properties:
      ipsec:
        ipsec_subnets:
        - 10.0.1.1/20
        no_ipsec_subnets:
        - 10.0.1.10/32 # bosh director
        instance_certificate: |
          -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
          MIIEMDCCAhigAwIBAgIRAIvrBY2TttU/LeRhO+V1t0YwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQELBQAw
          ...
          -----END CERTIFICATE-----
        instance_private_key: |
          -----BEGIN EXAMPLE RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
          MIIEogIBAAKCAQEAtAkBjrzr5x9g0aWgyDEmLd7m9u/ZzpK7UScfANLaN7JiNz3c
          ...
          -----END EXAMPLE RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
        ca_certificates:
          - |
          -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
          MIIEUDCCArigAwIBAgIJAJVLBeJ9Wm3TMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMB0xGzAZBgNV
          BAMMElBDRiBJUHNlYyBBZGRPbiBDQTAeFw0xNjA4MTUxNzQwNDVaFw0xOTA4MTUx
          ...
          -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

In the example above, the values that appear after the <code>ca_certificates</code>: key are contained within a list and are not just a single certificate.
This entry must be followed by a line starting with <code>-</code>, and ending with <code>|</code>. The lines following this contain the PEM encoded certificate(s).

The error message shown above indicating a problem with the <code>each\_with\_index</code> method provides a hint that the <code>- |</code> YAML syntax sequence is missing. Use this syntax even in situations where there is only one CA certificate, for example a list of one entry.

<hr>

#### Symptom
Complete system outage with no warning.

#### Explanation: <%= vars.product_short %> Certificates Might Have Expired
Expired <%= vars.product_short %> certificates can cause a sudden system outage.
For example, the self-signed certificates generated by the script provided in the installation instructions have a lifetime of 365 days.
<%= vars.product_short %> certificates expire if you do not rotate them within their lifetime.

#### Solution
Renew expired <%= vars.product_short %> certificates.
To avoid future downtime due to expired <%= vars.product_short %> certificates,
set a calendar reminder to rotate the certificates before they expire.

For how to renew certificates, see [Renewing Expired <%= vars.product_short %> Certificates](./renewing.html).
For how to rotate them, see [Rotating <%= vars.product_short %> Certificates](./credentials.html).

<hr>

#### Symptom
BOSH shows a VM in a failing state.
On the failing VM, `monit summary` shows `ipsec` with a status of `Does not exist`.

#### Explanation: <%= vars.product_short %> stopped/crashed and Monit Cannot Automatically Bring it Back Up.
<%= vars.product_short %> is required to be the first process to start and the last process to stop.
As a result, the start and stop scripts are located in `pre-start` and `post-stop`,
which is a concept to BOSH, but not to Monit.
Monit is not able to bring <%= vars.product_short %> back up automatically because it does not know what `pre-start` is.
After you run the `pre-start` manually, then Monit is able to detect <%= vars.product_short %> as healthy.

#### Solution
1. From the failing VM, run the following command as root: `/var/vcap/jobs/ipsec/bin/pre-start`
1. Run `monit summary`.
If the restart is successful, Monit shows `ipsec` with a status of `Running`.

#### Explanation

Clock global is trying to call an API of an app hosted in <%= vars.platform_code %>.
This API call is routed through your external load balancer to Gorouter, which
fails if you are using Network Load Balancers (NLB).

This is because of how NLBs manipulate the packet.
They make the source IP in the IP header the clock global's IP instead of the load balancer's IP.
When clock global communicates with the NLB, it does not use <%= vars.product_short %> because the NLB's IP is outside the <%= vars.product_short %> subnet.
However, when Gorouter sees that the source IP of the packet is clock global, it expects the packet to be encrypted with <%= vars.product_short %>.
It then drops the packet because it is not encrypted with <%= vars.product_short %>, resulting in a timeout.

#### Solution

Do not use Network Load Balancers as your external load balancer in your IaaS.
Use Level 7 load balancers.
To set one up, follow the steps in the guide for your IaaS below.

* For AWS, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/application-load-balancer-getting-started.html">the AWS documentation</a>.

* For GCP, see <a href="https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/setting-up-https">the Google Cloud documentation</a>.

* For Azure, see <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/application-gateway">the Microsoft Azure documentation</a>.
