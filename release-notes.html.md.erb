* **OpenSSL:** Upgraded to v1.0.2zg to address:

#### Known issues

* In some deployments, IPsec has undesired behavior when used with Jammy stemcells v1.18 to v1.83 (inclusive).
NATS communication failure causes BOSH jobs such as `route_registrar`, `nats-tls-healthcheck`,
`nats-tls-wrapper`, and `nats-wrapper` to fail. This causes the BOSH deployment to fail.
VMware recommends using IPsec with Jammy stemcell v1.93 and later.
For more information, see the [VMware Tanzu Support documentation](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/IPSec-Add-On-connectivity-Issues-on-Jammy-1-18-1-83?language=en_US).

###<a id="1-9-9"></a>  v1.9.9

* **Updates strongSwan to v5.6.3**. For more information, see [strongSwan 5.6.3 Released](https://www.strongswan.org/blog/2018/05/28/strongswan-5.6.3-released.html) in the strongSwan documentation.

created for the enablement of the following alerts: certificate expiration and optional
<%= vars.product_short %> enforcement.

* Subsequent deployments of <%= vars.product_short %> did not start due to existing stale process IDs.

### <a id="1-9-4"></a>  v1.9.4

**Release date:** June 28, 2018

#### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* Starting with BOSH Director v265.1.0, the BOSH job lifecycle includes a `post-stop` phase.
  The `charon` <%= vars.product_short %> daemon job is now stopped in the BOSH `post-stop` lifecycle
  phase instead of the BOSH `stop` lifecycle phase.
  The `stop` phase is now a no-op.
  This ensures the network remains available and secure while all other
  BOSH jobs perform their stop processing.

* Updates smoke tests to check connectivity using TCP protocol requests on port 22,
rather than issuing an ICMP ping request to the remote host.
  This ensures that the smoke test produces an accurate result, even when ICMP is not enabled.

* Updates smoke tests to skip the connectivity check on localhost, because strongSwan
does not create a transform when the source and destination addresses are equal.
