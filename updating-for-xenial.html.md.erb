title: Updating <%= vars.product_full %> to Run with Xenial Stemcells
owner: Security Engineering
---

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

<%= vars.platform_name %> products and tiles that are released after July 2018 require
Ubuntu Xenial stemcells instead of Ubuntu Trusty stemcells.
You need to verify that your <%= vars.product_full %> deployment is configured correctly to support <%= vars.platform_name %> products running on Xenial.

This topic describes how to determine if your existing deployment of <%= vars.product_short %> can be deployed to VMs that run on Xenial.
This topic also explains how to update your <%= vars.product_short %> if it does not support Xenial.

Follow the instructions on this page if you use <%= vars.product_short %> with any <%= vars.platform_name %> products or tiles
that use Xenial stemcells.
See [Product Tiles that Use Xenial Stemcells](#which) below.

##<a id="who-me"></a> Do I Need to Modify <%= vars.product_short %>?

<%= vars.product_short %> v1.9.9 runs correctly on Xenial-based VMs if the <%= vars.product_short %> runtime config
includes the `ubuntu-xenial` property.

Review the following table and make any required changes before you upgrade to Xenial stemcells.

<table class="nice">
    <col width="25%">
    <col width="75%">
    <th>If you are using this version of <%= vars.product_short %>…</th>
    <th>do the following…</th>
    <tr>
      <td>1.9.9 and later</td>
      <td>Verify that your runtime config file, <code>ipsec-addon.yml</code>, includes
<pre>
stemcell:
- os: ubuntu-trusty
- os: ubuntu-xenial
</pre>
        If it does not, then follow the procedure, <a href="#add">Add the Xenial Stemcell Property to <%= vars.product_short %></a> below.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>v1.9.4 and earlier</td>
            <td>Install <%= vars.product_short %> v1.9.9.</td>
          </tr>
</table>

If you use <%= vars.product_short %> without adding the `ubuntu-xenial` property to the runtime config,
the VMs running on Xenial are not able to communicate with the rest of the system.

## <a id="which"></a> Product Tiles that Use Xenial Stemcells

Ensure that you have added the `ubuntu-xenial` property to <%= vars.product_short %> runtime config
before you install any product tiles that use Xenial stemcells.

For a list of <%= vars.platform_name %> tile releases that now use Xenial,
see [Tiles Using Xenial Stemcells in <%= vars.platform_name %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/stemcells/xenial-tiles.html).


##<a id="add"></a> Add the Xenial Stemcell Property to <%= vars.product_short %>

If you use <%= vars.product_short %> v1.9.9 without the `ubuntu-xenial`
property in the runtime config, then you must add it to your
existing `ipsec-addon.yml` and redeploy. Follow these steps:

1. SSH into the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM.
   For how to do this, see [SSH into <%= vars.ops_manager %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh).

2. To retrieve and save the <%= vars.product_short %> runtime config, run the following command:

    ```
    bosh -e BOSH-ENVIRONMENT runtime-config –name ipsec > /tmp/ipsec-addon.yml
    ```

    Where `BOSH-ENVIRONMENT` is the alias you set for the BOSH Director.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e my-env runtime-config –name ipsec-addon > /tmp/ipsec-addon.yml </pre>


3. Edit the `ipsec-addon.yml` file to add `- os: ubuntu-xenial` under
    `properties: {}` as shown below:


    ```
    addons:
    - name: ipsec-addon
      jobs:
      - name: ipsec
        release: ipsec
        properties: {}
      include:
        stemcell:
        - os: ubuntu-trusty
        - os: ubuntu-xenial
    ```

4. To update the runtime config, run the following command:

    ```
    bosh -e BOSH-ENVIRONMENT update-runtime-config --name=ipsec /tmp/ipsec-addon.yml
    ```

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">bosh -e my-env update-runtime-config --name=ipsec-addon /tmp/ipsec-addon.yml</pre>

5. Navigate to the Installation Dashboard in <%= vars.ops_manager %>.

6. If you are using <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.3 or later, click **Review Pending Changes**.
   For more information about this <%= vars.ops_manager %> page,
   see [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/review-pending-changes.html).

7. Click **Apply Changes**.
